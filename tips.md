# Tooltips in RE/Malware Anaysis

## Yourself
* Don't be afraid about new stuff.
* There is no age limitation for learning RE/Malware analysis.
* Don't believe that new field like reverse engineering is extremely hard, it's in fact easier than you think
* When you have no idea about what the malware do, don't think at first that you are bad/rookie, it means that you will learn new stuff, it's the most important thing to notice.
* Mistake are part of the process, and it's important to make mistakes.
* Mistake/Failures are probably one of the best thing that could happen to you, it's incredibly worth for learning.
* You will learn during all your life, don't think that you have to know "everything" in the first days, it's impossible to know litterally everything in that field, just take your time.
* Papers, Work, Projects, Tools are proofs that you have done something, popular or not, it's a satisfaction to some work done.
* Don't hurry on something new, it's the best way to make irreversible mistakes. 
* Frustration is part of the process, learn to deal with it.
* if you someone said to you that it's mandatory to have certifications or required diploma in IT for starting this field, this dude is ridiculous.
* It's stupid to say it's impossible whenever you didn't try it once.

## Learning
* Notes are mandatory
* Practice, Practice, Practice... 
* There is no fundamental path into RE/Malware Analysis, i could say that everyone path is different even if some branches are identicals.
* Write some programs and do some reverse on them (Also play with the compilers options to understand the differences).
* In my opinion, it's better that you take your time with a few analysis tools/software than a dozens.  
* Read a lot of code, if you think it's decent to run it, compiled and do some RE again.
* Something that you don't understand one day, you will get it on another case and will blow your mind... this is some magic that i love when it comes.
* If english is not your main language, learn this one and put your notes/papers/comments in that language. It's easier to show your work to others.
* When people say it's expensive to learn RE i could say they are wrong, i've build my first lab setup with low-cost computers threw on streets and free softwares so... 
* Some CTF/CrackMe challenges are fun way to learn also some interesting things.
* Take breaks, especially when you have struggles in some analysis.
* 20/30 min dedicated everyday on reading/analyzing new stuff shared by the community is incredibly worth after weeks, months. (don't forget to make notes about it) 
    - Twitter
    - Specialized websites
    - Technical Papers

## Malware Analysis
* If you want to verify something, read/eat the code
* Reverse everything that dig your curiosity, even if it's stupid, you will learn somewhat something, for further investigations.
* A specific POST/GET request pattern doesn't mean this is always the same malware, be careful about this.
* It's better to focus on one family than multiple, take your time, nobody will push you to do other things, it all up to you to decide. [Ransomware / Banker / Infostealers / Loaders...]
* Of course, when you considered that you have seen all the apsect of one, go to another one but always keep an eye on new species.
* Never trust tags, comments on sandboxes, VT, and others...
* Seriously, never trust tags, comments on sandboxes, VT, and others...
